                    The only way to stop pollution on the land and in the oceans
                    is to prevent getting any unnecessary waste on the ground and
                    into water.
                </p>    
                <p class="page-text">
                    While pollution is on the ground, the further
                    development of the process is dissolving and getting into water
                    streams of rivers and then to the seas and oceans. Dissolving
                    waste takes hundreds of years. Therefore, we can't wait and
                    need to act now. We can stop the dumping the waste and we can
                    collect  those that already on the ground by our own efforts.

                    It's important not to ignore this problem and work to make our
                    planet clean and healthier as it was just few decades ago.
                    Waiting for your participation and the realisation that
                    everyone's good hopes of our planet's future can be achieved
